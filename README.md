### Introduction

>Fuzz testing or fuzzing is a software testing technique, often automated or semi-automated, that involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data to the inputs of a computer program. The program is then monitored for exceptions such as crashes, or failing built-in code assertions or for finding potential memory leaks. Fuzzing is commonly used to test for security problems in software or computer systems. It is a form of random testing which has been used for testing hardware or software.

This script applies the concept of fuzzing to the Safari browser on iOS devices. It was written to help the [OpenJailbreak](https://twitter.com/OpenJailbreak) group (which I was a part of) find vulnerabilities in the way Safari handled QuickTime video rendering that could potentially be exploited to help create a jailbreak.

### Dependencies

* A jailbroken iOS device

* [zzuf](http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/zzuf)

* lighttpd (Available on Cydia)


### Usage

###### Initial Setup
1. Change the `server.document-root` in [config.conf](/config.conf) to whatever directory your .mov file is in.
2. Change `file=Demo`in [fuzz.sh](/fuzz.sh) to `file=File` where `File` is the name of your .mov file without the extension.

###### After Setup
1. Run "lighttpd -Df config.conf".
2. Navigate to localhost:8080 in Safari.
3. Refresh.
4. Repeat until Safari crashes.

### Documentation

I wrote two blog articles on the subject in 2014. They are:

* http://nexuist.tumblr.com/post/63803138975/fuzzing-mov-files-on-ios-part-1-introduction-to

* http://nexuist.tumblr.com/post/63805795558/fuzzing-mov-files-on-ios-part-2-supercharging

These will probably move somewhere else at some point. For now, they should stay available.

### A Better Solution

This concept was taken and expanded upon in [fuzzyDuck](https://github.com/isa56k/fuzzyDuck) by isa56k, another OpenJailbreak member.

I recommend you use fuzzyDuck instead of Mobile-ZZUF. This project is just here for historical purposes.
